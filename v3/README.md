Cube3d V3.

GOAL
Probably have to restruct the header file from V2- Goal is to move the image and only show its cordiantes, not the previous one. 
I'm going to start by parsing a map- and puting the player at position P. Then I will try to move him with AWSD. It should only like mentioned above ^

ACCOMPLISH
Doing it on VIM was tough, but worth it. There are sevaral new functions. Take your time to understand it. About 2 days of work. Hope it helps. The main thing to take away is that
-it is all 1 image- on a constant loop of a map array- parsed to the screen
You can MOVE around with wasd

TO LOOK FOWARD TO
vacations...
next step I guess is to make a raycast 
++before that maybe make a minimap ft so this is uselessfor the project itself.
